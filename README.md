# Django API Project 
This project was created to explore the intricacies of the Django REST Framework. It features an API designed for an e-commerce product company. Additionally, Python and JavaScript clients were developed to test the API's functionality. Notably, the project integrates Algolia's powerful search engine API, enhancing search capabilities. CORS was implemented to facilitate testing.

Feel free to tweak it further to better fit your project's style and tone!
